NewLib 3.0.0 for WarpOS
=======================

This is an implementation of NewLib 3.0.0 for WarpOS.

In libglosswos you can find the glue and extra functions.

In newlib you can find the adapted original libc functions. I tried
to leave newlib as clean as possible, but still had to adapt some files.
Better solutions are welcome, of course.
